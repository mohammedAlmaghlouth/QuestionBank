# JavaFX Question Bank Creator

The JavaFX Question Bank Creator is a project developed as part of the T202 - ICS 108 Lab Project at KFUPM, work as team of two members. 
It is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to create, modify, and manage questions in a question bank.

## Project Description

The JavaFX Question Bank Creator is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for creating and managing questions in a question bank.
The application allows users to create multiple choice questions with options, specify correct answers, and save the questions in a binary file named "QuestionBank.dat". Users can also modify and delete questions, and the changes are automatically saved for future use.

## Solution Description

The solution is implemented using JavaFX, a Java library for creating desktop applications with rich graphical user interfaces. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, where the model represents the data (questions), the view represents the graphical user interface, and the controller handles user interactions.

### Features

The JavaFX Question Bank Creator includes the following features:

- Create new questions with multiple choice options.
- Modify existing questions and save changes.
- Delete questions from the question bank.
- Automatically save questions in a binary file for future use.
- User-friendly graphical user interface with easy-to-use controls.

## Conclusion

Working on the JavaFX Question Bank Creator was a fun and fruitful experience. We learned various aspects of Java programming, including designing graphical user interfaces and handling data files. The team's collaboration skills were also enhanced through this project, and we look forward to working on more projects in the future.
